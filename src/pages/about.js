            <p>
                I am a Front End Web Developer from Utah with a Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Digital Media with an emphasis
                in Internet Technologies from Utah Valley University. I have been studying in this field for 4+ years.
                Along with my formal schooling I have taken on various freelance projects and additional self-prescribed
                education to help boost my skills in this ever-changing field. With various skills in Internet
                Technologies and digital publishing, along with a strong desire to learn and grow, I&#39;m in search of
                exciting opportunities to help further my knowledge and expertise in the web development world.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is nothing I&#39;m not willing to devote myself to learning. If you have a problem that requires a
                technology that I don&#39;t already have experience with, you can bet I&#39;ll be the first to jump in
                and start learning it. With an almost insatiable appetite for learning new technologies and growing as a
                web developer, you can count on me to help solve your problems.
            </p>
