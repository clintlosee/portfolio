            As a <strong>full stack engineer</strong>, I have demonstrated my
            ability to <strong>crush it</strong> on both the front end and back
            end. I am fluent in <strong>Ruby and JavaScript</strong>. I am also
            quite competent with many <strong>modern frameworks</strong> such as
            React, Redux, Rails and Node. I <strong>love to code</strong> and am
            so happy that I get to <strong>learn and create</strong> new things
            every day!

            and also to create, so I studied{' '}
            <strong>earth science and education</strong> in college and became a
            teacher in New York City shortly after graduating. I{' '}
            <strong>taught science</strong> for seven years to students in
            grades 8 - 12. Students generally agreed that my class was{' '}
            <strong>'lit'</strong>. Eventually I realized that{' '}
            <strong>I missed being creative</strong> so I got back into coding
            with HTML and CSS, a hobby I'd had since I was a kid on Xanga, and
            began learning JavaScript. I immediately knew that coding was
            something I could do{' '}
